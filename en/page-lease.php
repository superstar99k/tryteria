					<p class="txt-body">
						The initial cost for a lease/rental contract can be a quarter of the purchase cost. 
						For example, as opposed to purchasing a range of furniture worth ¥1,000,000, the total initial cost for a lease/rental would be somewhere around ¥200,000, 
						including coordination and delivery fees, deposit, and an initial lease charge. 
						This means that the expenses incurred at the start of furniture lease could be about one fifth of the purchase price.

			<h3>MAY’S furniture lease/rental service</h3>
			<p class="lease-faq-question">
				Q. How is it different from other furniture rental services?
			</p>
			<p class="lease-faq-answer">
				Our service differs from others in that we can propose a combination of brand-new furniture and end-of-lease products. <br>
				When purchasing high-end furniture, you can often choose upholstery from various types of leather or fabric and decide detailed specifications. <br>
				The brand-new furniture that meets your specific requirements can be combined with affordable, well-maintained end-of-lease products.

			<h3>Trouble during use</h3>
			<p class="lease-faq-question">
				Q. What happens if I stain an item?
			</p>
			<p class="lease-faq-answer">
				You will not be held responsible for small scratches and stains from normal use.<br>
				However, you will be charged for stains caused by your negligence, such as cigarette burns and wine stains, as well as any damages that cannot be repaired by cleaning performed as part of maintenance. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="lease-faq-box">
			<h3>Midterm cancellation</h3>
			<p class="lease-faq-question">
				Q. If I cancel my contract in the middle of the term, do I need to pay the remaining value of the contract?
			</p>
			<p class="lease-faq-answer">
				In principle, a midterm cancellation cannot be made within the lease period set at the time of the initial contract. <br>
				There is a penalty in the case of cancellation. <br>
				However, if the contract has been renewed at least once, it can be cancelled by making a payment for the month in which you last use the service.
